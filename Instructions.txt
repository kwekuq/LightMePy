Purpose
LightMePy is meant to provide an easy and quick way to use the GPIO on a raspberry pi to light LED's. The aim is to have
to type in one or two lines of code and you are up and running.
You can import it as a module and use it as easy as that.

Use
To use LightMePy you will provide which ports to use in the lights list, just add them to the list.
You will then need to run setup, then chose which function(blink, on, off) you want to execute.
If you want to run the lights for a specific about of time then you will just use period with which ever function you
chose. As easy as that.
